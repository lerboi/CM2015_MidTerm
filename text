Challenges
- Need to use Selenium library along with Beautifulsoup for Web scraping as data in leagueofgraphs are dynamically loaded with JS.

- Since Selenium is used, need to use chromedriver. Installed in project folder

- API Rate limit is 20 request per second, and 100 request per 2 minutes. So took preventive measures like adding time.sleep in between to prevent hitting the limit.


DATA FIELDS - 
Player Name, UUID, Day, Win
